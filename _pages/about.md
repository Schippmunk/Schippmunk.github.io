I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/) supervised by [Ulrik Buchholtz](www.ulrikbuchholtz.dk) and [Nicolai Kraused](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psznk/).

My research focuses on homotopy type theory, geometric type theory and related topics.
